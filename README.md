# House of Representatives vs. Taxes Analysis


## ==Introduction & Background== 

In general, I find politics very interesting. It's no secret that as a result of the last couple presidential elections, the US political climate has become a lot more polarized. Because of this increased bitterness between the democratic and republican party, the stereotypes associated with each party have deepened. People are quick to believe any and all accusations made toward the opposite party. Using these two datasets I am exploring two assumptions. Firstly, that more power to the democratic party results in a higher personal income tax. Secondly, that the power to te Republican party results in less taxation for businesses. These stereotypes are among the least controversial made about each party. However, I am still curious to see whether or not they hold true based on actual data. 

I used the following specific questions to explore these two assumptions based on the data available to me: 
1. Is there actually a positive correlation between the percentage of Democrats in power in the house and an increase in individual income taxes (within the years 1946-2018)? 

2. Is there really a proportional decrease in corporate taxes when there is an increase in proportion of Republicans in power in the house (within the years 1946-2018)? 

In seeking the answers to these questions, I hope to generate some food for thought concerning whether or not the stereotypes that have been made so central to US politics have any truth to them.
