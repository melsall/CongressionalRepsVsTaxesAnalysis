# House of Representatives vs. Taxes Analysis


## ==Introduction & Background== 

In general, I find politics very interesting. It's no secret that as a result of the last couple presidential elections, the US political climate has become a lot more polarized. Because of this increased bitterness between the democratic and republican party, the stereotypes associated with each party have deepened. People are quick to believe any and all accusations made toward the opposite party. Using these two datasets I am exploring two assumptions. Firstly, that more power to the democratic party results in a higher personal income tax. Secondly, that the power to te Republican party results in less taxation for businesses. These stereotypes are among the least controversial made about each party. However, I am still curious to see whether or not they hold true based on actual data. 

I used the following specific questions to explore these two assumptions based on the data available to me: 
1. The democratic party is generally the party associated with higher income taxes. Is the average percentage of federal revenue from income tax actually higher when democrats have a house majority?
2. Is there a positive correlation between amount of Republicans and power and the percent of federal revenue from corporate income taxes? 

In seeking the answers to these questions, I hope to generate some food for thought concerning whether or not the stereotypes that have been made so central to US politics have any truth to them. 

## ==Methods== 
### Datasets Used
This project involved combining two different datasets. 

The first dataset had detalied information about the percentages of representatives from each major political party in the house from 1946-2018. This dataset was generated by a company called Brookings, under their "Vital Statistics on Congress" umbrella. Using publicly available data, Thomas E. Mann of Brookings and Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute compliled this data, making it more usable to the public. 

The second dataset contained data on the percent federal revenue from different types of taxes from 1934-2012. This dataset is from the Tax Foundation. They compiled this data using publicly available tax archives from the whitehouse via the www.whitehouse.gov website. 
### Coding Process
Certain pieces of information were key to answering both of the questions. From both datasets, the year of the corresponding data needed to be tracked in order to match the correct pieces of data across datasets. Furthermore, the percentage of democrats in the house of those years needed to be tracked (the republican percentage could be obtained by doig 100 - democratic percentage). 

Specifically for research question 1, the "Individual Income Tax" file needed to be accessed from the tax dataset. For research question 2, the "Corporate Income Tax" file needed to be accessed form the tax dataset. 

One issue that came up was that the datasets did not align in their range of years. This issues was resolved by making minYear and maxYear a parameter for the major methods. This way, the code would only grab data relating to acceptable years. Another issue was that I parameterized my code to an extent that a single method answered both of my research questions. My second research question used to check if the average percent federal revenue from corporate taxes was higher in Republican Years or Democrat years. However, because I made the parameter taxType for the compareTaxesBasedOnParty method, this question could be answered by the same method as question 1. Therefore I changed my second question to seek the correlation coefficient between these two variables. 


##Conclusion

### Research Question 1: 
Here, the results show that Democrats tax individuals slightly higher according to the data. For the years where the democratic party had power in the house, the average percent federal revenue from individual income taxes was about 89.1%. The Republican party's percent federal revenue from individual income tax during the same years was 85.9%. Obviously, this difference is small, and there are a lot of other variables that affect taxation other than just the house majority. The economy, the political party of the president, and the political majority of the senate to name a few. Because the difference between the two parties is not that large, it is hard to make a concrete conclusion on whether this really proves that democratic power = higher individual taxes. 

### Research Question 2:
The correlation coefficient between the percentage of democrats in power and a percentage of corporate income taxes was .0339. To summarize, the correlation between the two are basically nonexistent. Politics are certainly a sensitive topic, so I am hesitant to claim any concrete comparisons based on what is a relatively novice research project. However, based on the data I utilized the stereotype of democrats raising taxes on corporations is false. This conclusion could well be false, but based on the data I used, there is not a strong correlation between these two variables. 

### Further Research
Given more time, I would love to consider more variables in this comparison. For instance, I would like to use data from the senate to help determine whether a year really is a year with more democratic and republican power. I would alwso like to use more advanced java libraries to graphically represent this data.
